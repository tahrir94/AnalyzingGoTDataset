# AnalyzingGoTDataset
Analysis of kaggle dataset using Python packages for data wrangling, visualization, and logistic regression. The python file "GoT.py" performs the analysis and I used PyCharm IDE with Ananconda3 interpreter for debugging and running the code.

The csv file "battles.csv" needs to be downloaded into the root folder from: https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones/data?select=battles.csv

The project analyzes game of thrones battle data from the csv file to extract meaningful information. Details of code implementation and analysis of results can be found in the pdf "Final_report". The catplots, heat map, confusion matrices, and results of logisitic regressions from my run are all included in the repo.
