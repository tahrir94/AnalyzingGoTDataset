# AnalyzingGoTDataset
Analysis of kaggle dataset using Python packages for data wrangling, visualization, and logistic regression. I used PyCharm IDE with Ananconda3 for debugging and running the code.

The csv file "battles.csv" needs to be downloaded into the root folder from: https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones/data?select=battles.csv

The project analyzes game of thrones battle data from the csv file to extract meaningful information. The python file "GoT.py" performs the analysis and details of the implementation can be found in the word document "Final_report". The heat map, confusion matrix, and results of  logisitic regression form my run are all attached.
